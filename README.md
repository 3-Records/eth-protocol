## Music NFT 

- Try on and off chain
    - IPFS
    - On chain will probably be very gas expensive but look into it



Look into sound.xyz



Could focus more on concert recordings 
each nft/recoring could have a differnt picture of the event


eip 2981 for royalties


Id want different images or atrwork from the event to be randomly assigned to each token and maybe a digital signature that are different. Make each unique so some can be more desired than others.


end goal would to be able to use usdc instead of native token like eth, but eth is definetly easier
